<h3> App for children with special educational needs (SEN) </h3>

<h5>Description</h5>

App for children with special educational needs from the age of seven, in this first phase of development, the focus is from seven to ten years old. As a main tool we use games with a reward system to help develop the student's cognitive skills. 

Functionalities:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
